**Summary**

The files within extract and manipulate data within two CSV inputs to generate a series of Bokeh visualizations.

**Project Description**

For the final project of a Data Visualizations class, I wrote a paper comparing the geological data from two different GEO datasets of elements within different regions in Alaska, US that were gathered ~3027 years apart and researched contextual factors that could have contributed to said differences. A series of visualizatons were created by importing two datasets, manipulating the containing data within dataframes, and extracting various data points to create visualizations using bokeh.

**Skills Learned**

-Utilizing pandas library to load and manipulate datasets
-Importing custom-made functions from another Python file
-Using bokeh to create different types of data visualizations from created dataframes

**Libraries Required**

-pandas
-bokeh
-numpy
