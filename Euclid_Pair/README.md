**Summary**

The Euclid_Pair project calculates the shortest distances between a set of generated Cartesian points and the time required for the process.

**Project Description**

The Euclidean distance measures the shortest distance between two points, which is defined as the Pythagorean distance between said points. In this project, a set of Point objects are randomly generated based on user input, and the Euclidean distances are measured between every single point combination. The Euclidean distances are then sorted by length using a merge sort and is outputted in a text file along with the time required for the entire process to run.
